Program Repository for Tools for Analyzing Infectious Disease Sequence Data and Forecasting Public Health Outcomes
========

This repository contains all open source code developed for the studies, experiments, and publications for the Directed Research project entitled, "Merging Sequence Data with Epidemiological Forecasting to Predict Future Pandemics." This project began in Fiscal Year 2024 at Los Alamos National Lab under the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program.  The project leads are:
* Sara Del Valle (PI) <sdelvall@lanl.gov>;
* Dave Osthus (co-PI) <dosthus@lanl.gov>;
* Will Fischer (co-PI) <wfischer@lanl.gov>.

For questions, issues, or clarifications on individual projects, contact information is available in the appropriate project directory..

This repository is organized according to the different directories needed to perform the experiment in the paper.  Additional directories will be added as projects complete:

* incidence_for_sir: code to perform the studies and data application for the Murph et al. 2024 publication (see below);
