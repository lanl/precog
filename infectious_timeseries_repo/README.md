\cf3 Basic Information
\f2\b0 \
This repository contains a collection infectious disease time series data obtained from a variety of publicly-available sources compiled as part of the \cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Directed Research project entitled, "Merging Sequence Data with Epidemiological Forecasting to Predict Future Pandemics." This project began in Fiscal Year 2024 at Los Alamos National Lab under the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program. The project leads are:\

The organized and cleaned data are provided in\cf5  /_Organized_Lists\cf3 . These lists are structured such that each element of the list contains an infectious disease time series for a particular location, disease, data source, reporting cadence (e.g., daily vs weekly) and endpoint. For more information about the structure of these lists, see \cf5 Summarize_Data.pptx\cf3 . \
\
Within each data source folder, we provide information about how we accessed the data and code we used to clean the data from each source. To facilitate modeling, observed weekly data were assigned to the nearest regular week or recast to follow an exactly weekly cycle (with zero-count weeks added as appropriate). This did not always align exactly with the actual reporting dates for the individual data streams. In general, \cf5 see each data source\'92s README\cf3  for information about data cleaning choices made and how the original reporting dates were recorded. Users wanting a more careful look at the reporting dates in the original data (for example, to harmonize these data with other data streams or to do detailed epidemiological studies) should dig into the data cleaning code or return to the original data source rather than use our processed data. The goal of this repository is to provide a database of infectious disease time series data to use for training and validating predictive models, and our data processing choices reflect this. \
