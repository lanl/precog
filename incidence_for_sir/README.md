Code for Experiment in Publication “Incorporating Incidence Peak and Time Data for SIR Forecasting Applications”
========

All code used to perform the experiment in the cited publication.  For questions, issues, or clarifications please reach out to Murph: <murph@lanl.gov>.

This repository is organized according to the different directories needed to perform the experiment in the paper.  These directories are:

* application: code to perform the application in the paper (Section 5);

* paper_graphic: code to create Figure 1 in the paper;

* prevalence_maps: code that performs all _prevalence_ maps discussed in the paper (Section 2);

* simulation_study: code to perform the simulation study in the paper (Section 3);


## Software and Data Required
To fit the models discussed in the paper, one needs access to [JAGS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/).  The data required for this experiment is available upon request from the authors of [Osthus et al. 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28979611/).
